## Section 6: Usage

The two main features of the application are categories and items. Once on the home page, you can create a new category using the button at the bottom of the page.

Once a category is created, you can create items within that category by visiting that category's page and clicking to create a new item at the bottom of the page.

You can also edit and delete any categories or items that the user has created. You're not able to edit or delete items or categories that you didn't create.

You can also access JSON pages for category and user information. Simply navigate to that specific category or item page, and add '/JSON' to the end of the URL.
